Today we're talking about storytelling
If yoy want your content to perform better
you need to learn how to tell better stories
so this video I'm going to walk through my six favorite
storytelling techniques that will massively improve your content
after watching this I guarantee you will think differently
about the way you write scripts and make videos by the way I'm Callaway 
I've pulled over a billion views on short from video
I've got 500,000 followers and I think about this stuff all the time 
all right let's drive in tip number one:
1. Is what I call the dance? All great stories are like a dance between
context and conflict you give a little context the characters on a mission 
they're doing something and then oh, oh no here comes a conflict you give a
little bit more context the characters have solved that first conflict
they're on their way and then oh, oh no another conflict. This dance is how
you keep the viewer locked in. It could be a feature film or a short from video.
The dance is always there now why does this work. 
Conflicts create open loops in the brain and then context helps close those loops.
The best explanation I've ever seen for how to tactically implement this dance idea
is from Matt Stone and Trey Parker. They're the ones who created South Park.
They're the ones who created South Park they were giving a talk at NYU watch this.
   - we found out this really simple rule that maybe you guys have all heard before. 
   But it took us a long time to learn it. But we can take these beats which are 
   basically the beats of your outline and if the words and then belong between
   those beats you're basically you got, you got something pretty boring. 
   What should happen between every beat that you've written down is either the
   word therefore or but. Right so so what I'm saying is that you come up with 
   an idea and it's like okay this happens right. And then this happens no no no
   It should be this happens and therefore this happens but this happens therefore
   this happens and that as soon as we are able to and literally sometimes we'll
   Write it out to make sure we're doing it. We'll have our beats and we'll say 
   okay this happened but then this happens and that affects this and that does 
   to that and that's why you get a show that feels like okay this to that to 
   this to that but this here's the complication to that

So tactically it's as simple as using the words but and therefore consistently
throughout your script that will create those open conflict loops. 
If you're using the words and then it'll feel like you're piling on detail after 
detail after detail and viewer will lose interest. Now let's quickly take a 
look at one of my best performing videos you'll notice there are four but 
then conflict loops in the first 30 seconds. Watch this:
    - Something crazy is happening with Stanley Cups 
        - you ever seen on of these Stanley Cups
