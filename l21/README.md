### long story short

I think a lot of times we just get completely
blind (слепы) to our clutter and mess and we have
absolutely no idea how overwhelmed by our
surrounding (вокруг) we actually are we may feel
terrible we may notice that we're having anxious (тревожно)
thoughts or owledge that we're feeling depressed
or hopeless but I don't think that we always
make the connection that any of this could be
aggravated by our living space the truth is that
a chronically messy home or a disorganized work
space can affect us way more than just annoying
us or making our lives more difficult in reality

- clutter can have a huge impact on our mental
health we may not even have a clue how much
this issue is impairing (ухудшение) us because we're just
so used to living this ay so today i want to
talk about how toxic it really is even if we have
kind of learned to work around it or live with it
because it is affecting every aspect of our life

- and sometimes all it really takes is a wake-up call
to start making positive changes in our life now

- the science behind the chaos
our brains are wired to make sense of our environments which makes perfect sense
but when we are surrounded by mess and disorders all of the 
time our minds are kind of just bombarded by all of these
chaotic visual cues even when we don't consciously notice them anymore
our brain still will definitely see them and they have to work on
overdrive trying to process all of this information which makes it realy
difficult for us to be able to focus and relax/

- being in this contrast state of sensory overload can trigger our stress response
which leads to elevated (повышенный) cortisol levels and heightened (повышенный) anxiety (беспокойство)

- clutter can be a huge source of emotional baggage
- clutter directly interferes(мешает) with our sleep
- all this chaos can even impair (ухудшить) our cognitive abilities
- greatly hinder (препятствовать) our ability to concentrate, process information, and make decisions
- clutter can also greatly affect our self-esteem
- research has also linked clutter to depression
- when our surroundings are messy, it makes us feel
like we are not in control of our lives
- our clutter can be a physical manifestation (проявлением) of our internal chaos
- taking the smallest of steps will start to improve your mental health and overall well-being
