### Video
7% of your communication are the actual words you say/
38% are certain like intonation
55% is non-verbal things like face expression, gestures, posture
how to tweak those to make sure you're sending out all right signals.

1. adopt an engaged posture
   - to slouch in a chair
   - fold arms on the table
it makes you smaller wrapping yourself. 
It means you are defensive or nervous.
 - Instead open up your body, don't cross your legs or fold your arms.
 + Engage slightly forward from the waist. It will give the appearance 
 to the interviewer that you're interested

2. Appear calm and relaxed.
- If you're jiggling about a lot in the chair or you're playing with 
a button or rings or other objects - you're going to appear anxious and nervous
+ Slow your breathing down? this will slow heard rate and make you feel less nervy

3. Use the right hand gestures
+ keep your hand steady and only emphasize a point
+ palm upwards signified that you're saying is honest
+ touching your heart signifies that what you're saying is genuine
+ steepling is a sign of confidence
- conversely clasping your hands  is a sign of self-comfort and anxiety

4. Mirror the interviewer
- effective technique but it needs to be done very subtly
- murring hand movements or positive gestures waiting 10 secconds 
though before you do it yourself
- you can also mirror your speech their vocabulary their jargon 
the rate of volume of their speech
- people trust those that are similar to themselves
 
5. Get your eye contact right
rapport with them is so important interviewees often avoid the 
gaze of the interviewer or look down
eyes are asserting your confidence and trustworthiness
alternate your gaze between left, right side around mouse every 3 seconds
just enough to see the color of the interviewer's eyes
for panel interviews make sure you look at everybody but specifically 
pay attention on the person who's asking you question or speaking at the time

6. avoid lying signals
avoid touching your face - it means tha you are dishonest

7. Give the perfect handshake
   unspoken word that indicates conversation:
   you'll seem too dominant too weak
   you'll seem underconfidence instead always initiate the handshake 
match the interview's grip
apply some rules, smile and repeat their name

Practice you'll be giving off the right impression
