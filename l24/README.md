1. Create flow 
   - be able rely on your skills, instincts, trust your future, vision
   - the more can you trust future the more you engage in a present moment
2. Deep focus (two ways)
    - 1 way
      - totally have been focus, observed in your actions or tasks (more and more difficult)
      - multi task is killing or decrease your productivity by seventy percent
      - be completely focus on your task to increase your productivity
    - 2 way 
      - Be selective what you do, time you invest. You have to now your priorities.
      - (less that better, less than more ???)
3. Risk taking
   - I called it educated risk taking
   - Risk is different for everyone. It always depends on satisfactions
   - If satisfaction is bigger you will do it.
   - Do risks to be happy and satisfied
   - To create more flow in your environment you have to alloy yourself or people to take more risks and at the same time accept failure

I believe if you stop taking risks you stop living our life.
