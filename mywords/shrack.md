Shrek and Donkey going forth to rescue princess Fiona
They decided get close to come in fiery keep. 
On the way they met dragon and asked him tissue.
The dragon cut open his worn out clothes. 
And then the dragon started slobbering and become irritated.
Shrek thought the dragon is a big burden at that moment. 
Because the beast can decapitate him.
And then he saw brimstone on the ground and decided cool off the dragon.
Next moment appears muffin man. It was indeed eligible moment to come in.
And Shrek doesn't become abuse of this situation and started to run.
- Stalwart friend donkey didn't follow situation and cry hang on, hang on.
The patience of dragon was finished, and he forced to burn muffin man. 
The fire moved through and nothing was happened, with him. 
Because muffin man is magical creature.
