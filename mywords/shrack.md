Shrek and Donkey going forth to rescue princess Fiona
They decided to get close to come in fiery keep. 
On the way they met dragon and asked him tissue.
The dragon cut open his worn out clothes. 
And then the dragon started slobbering and became irritated.

Shrek thought the dragon is a big burden at that moment. 
Because the beast can decapitate him.
And then he saw brimstone on the ground and decided cool the dragon off.
Next moment appears muffin man. It was indeed eligible moment to come in.

And Shrek didn't become abuse of this situation and started to run.

Stalwart friend donkey didn't follow situation and shouted hang on, hang on.

The patience of dragon was finished, and he forced to burn muffin man. 
The fire moved through and nothing happened.

Muffin man is magical creature. He put up the shield which defended him.
Then he sacrificed gumdrop-buttons. And gave them to dragon.

And go on, and so forth...

The dragon wiped slobbery and looked at bachelorette in the tower.
And started go forth as noble man. 
The muffin man said "Hang on hideous dragon! Where are you going?" 
And whistled as strong as possible.

In that time Shrek And Donkey came in tower as whirlwind and saw 
lovely princess Fiona.

Mentally she was not good, but they hadn't time to think about it.
They need to leave the fiery keep before dragon fire this tower.
Shrek knew that possessed princess was wanted. He told donkey to be careful.
Because she likes eating donkeys.

She heard it and started swear. - I didn't do it! Believe me!

Donkey started imagine as princess squeeze him and all fluid from his eye drop to the ground.

Shrek said "Don't stop little fella" and donkey woke up.
On the way the dragon wanted to seize them and grind thayer bones.
Damn - said princess Fiona. What is happening? 
Some enchantments cast on me. And now I am crazy.
